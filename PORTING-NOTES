= Architecture: Atmel AVR

== ANY Branch

We should enable some very easy way of
adding support for any extra AVR chip!

This may require some new structure in
place, but giving generic names to things
and then adding a header for every chip
would be quite appropriate.

Of course there is one reason why someone
may wish to use anything other then
GCC with AVR LIBC, but these can be
adjusted as well.

== Arduino Branch

=== Support for all 'official' Arduinos

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino#Hardware

Arduino Board	Atmel AVR MCU	Flash/EEPROM/SRAM	GPIO/PWM/ADC
Diecimila	ATmega168	16/0.5/1		14/6/6
Duemilanove	ATmega328	32/1/2			14/6/6
Uno		ATmega328	32/1/2			14/6/6
Mega		ATmega1280	128/4/8			54/14/16
Fio		ATmega328P	32/1/2			14/6/8
Mega2560	ATmega2560	256/4/8			54/14/16

Support for ATmega8U2, which is used in newer versions also
may be added, someone may whish to make use of this too.

In regards to ATmega328P vs ATmega328, suffix 'P' stands for
'PicoPower', which means that these two chips should be the
physically the same.

Looks like all that has too be done is adding these:
* mega1280
* mega2560

Are any other chips used on different boards out there ?

If anyone has the expensive BlueTooth board, it may be nice
to get this working with 6loWPAN !!

= Architecture: Other XXX
== Other Branch
=== Support for SOMETHING
